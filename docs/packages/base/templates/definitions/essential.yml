# Essential definitions
#
# This file defines node types that are currently essential to running Courses or any of its subprojects.
# The nodes represent elements that have been directly parsed from the Markdown-like source format.
#
# These definitions should not be modified because the default parser expects these nodes to exist in this
# format. Instead, add your own custom node types if you need additional functionality.
