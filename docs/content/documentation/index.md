# Documentation
This is the user documentation for `courses`. It covers most of the current features in a series of short articles. The webpage itself acts as a sort of self-documenting example project, since it is written using Courses. The source code is available in the [repository](https://github.com/antonmeskildsen/courses/tree/main/docs).
